2.1 Concept of Security Vulnerability:
A security vulnerability, in the context of computer systems and software, refers to a weakness or flaw that can be exploited by malicious individuals or software to compromise the security of a system or gain unauthorized access to data, services, or resources. Security vulnerabilities can take various forms, such as software bugs, misconfigurations, design flaws, or human errors. They are typically unintended and can expose systems to a range of threats, including hacking, data breaches, and unauthorized access.
2.2 SQL Injection and How to Prevent It:
SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate an application's SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code. This can lead to unauthorized access, data disclosure, data manipulation, or denial of service. SQL Injection attacks are most commonly associated with web applications that interact with a database using SQL queries. To prevent SQL Injection, consider the following best practices:
a. Parameterized Queries and Prepared Statements:
•	Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with a database. This allows the database engine to distinguish between code and data and prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code.
b. Input Validation:
•	Implement strict input validation on all user inputs, whether they come from web forms, URL parameters, or any other source. Reject or sanitize any input that doesn't conform to expected patterns.
c. Escaping User Input:
•	If you need to include user input in SQL queries, escape it properly to neutralize any potentially harmful characters. Many programming languages and frameworks provide functions for this purpose.
d. Least Privilege Principle:
•	Assign the least privilege required for the application to access the database. Avoid using an account with excessive permissions, as this can limit the potential damage of a successful SQL Injection attack.
e. Web Application Firewall (WAF):
•	Use a Web Application Firewall that can help detect and block common SQL Injection attempts.
f. Regular Updates and Patch Management:
•	Keep your database management system and application software up to date with the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
